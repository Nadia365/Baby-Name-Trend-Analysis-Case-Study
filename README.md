## üõ†Ô∏è Overview
With the **Baby Name Trend Analysis Case Study**, I queried data to bring insights to the following objectives:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Track changes in name popularity 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Compare popularity across decades 

3Ô∏è‚É£ Compare popularity across regions 

4Ô∏è‚É£ Explore unique names in the dataset 

## üöÄ Solutions 

![Question 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-1-971901) 
*Find the overall most popular girl and boy names and show how they have changed in popularity rankings over the years
```sql
SELECT Name, sum(Births) AS num_babies
FROM names 
WHERE Gender='F'
GROUP BY name 
ORDER BY num_babies DESC
LIMIT 1;
---Jessica
```sql
SELECT * FROM
(WITH girl_names AS (SELECT Year, Name , sum(births) AS num_babies 
FROM names
where gender='F' 
Group by Year, Name) 
SELECT Year, Name,
row_number() over (partition by year order by num_babies DESC) AS popularity  
FROM girl_names ) AS popular_girl_names
WHERE name='Jessica' ;
```

```sql
SELECT Name, sum(Births) AS num_babies
FROM names 
WHERE Gender='M'
GROUP BY name 
ORDER BY num_babies DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
---Micheal  

```sql
SELECT * FROM
(WITH girl_names AS (SELECT Year, Name , sum(births) AS num_babies 
FROM names
where gender='M' 
Group by Year, Name) 
SELECT Year, Name,
row_number() over (partition by year order by num_babies DESC) AS popularity  
FROM girl_names ) AS popular_girl_names
WHERE name='Micheal' ;
```
![Question 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-2-971901)  
*Find the names with the biggest jumps in popularity from the first
 year of the data set to the last year
```sql
WITH names_1980 AS (
	 WITH all_names AS (
	 SELECT year, name, sum(births) as num_babies
	 FROM names 
	 GROUP by year, name)
	 SELECT year, name ,
	 row_number() OVER (partition by year order by num_babies DESC) AS popularity 
	 FROM all_names 
     WHERE year=1980
	 ) ,   
names_2009 AS(
	 WITH all_names AS (
	 SELECT year, name, sum(births) as num_babies
	 FROM names 
	 GROUP by year, name)
	 SELECT year, name ,
	 row_number() OVER (partition by year order by num_babies DESC) AS popularity
     FROM all_names 
	 WHERE year=2009) 
SELECT t1.year, t1.name, t1.popularity, t2.year, t2.name, t2.popularity, 
CAST(t2.popularity AS SIGNED) - CAST(t1.popularity AS SIGNED) AS diff
FROM names_1980 t1 INNER JOIN names_2009 t2 
ON t1.name=t2.name
ORDER BY diff ;
```
![Question 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-3-971901)  
For each year, return the 3 most popular girl names and 3 most popular boy names  
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM 
(WITH babies_by_year AS (SELECT Year, Gender, Name, sum(births) AS num_babies
FROM names 
GROUP by year, Gender, Name ) 
SELECT year, Gender, Name, num_babies, 
row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY year, gender ORDER BY num_babies DESC) AS popularity 
FROM babies_by_year ) AS Top_three
WHERE popularity <4;
```
 
 ![Question 4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-3-971901) 
 For each decade, return the 3 most popular girl names and 3 most popular boy names 
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM 
(WITH babies_by_decade AS (SELECT (CASE WHEN year between 1980 AND 1989 THEN 'Eighties'
                                WHEN year between 1990 AND 1999 THEN 'Nineties' 
                                WHEN year between 2000 AND 2010 THEN 'Two thousands'
                                ELSE 'None' END ) AS decade , 
Gender, Name, sum(births) AS num_babies
FROM names 
GROUP by decade, Gender, Name )

WHERE popularity <4;
```
![Question 5](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-3-971901) 
Return the number of babies born in each of the six regions (NOTE: The state of MI should be in the Midwest region) 
```sql
WITH clean_regions AS ( SELECT State , 
CASE when Region='New England' THEN 'New_England' ELSE Region END AS clean_region

ON n.State=cr.State 
GROUP BY clean_region ;
```

## üíª Key Highlight 
This project helped me to have a better understanding about data exploration using SQL from theories to real life application.

Some of the main areas covered in this case study, including:
* **Sorting Values**
* **Inspect Row Counts** 
* **USE of CTE and subqueries**
* **Join Use and string manipulation**
* **Problem Solving**
